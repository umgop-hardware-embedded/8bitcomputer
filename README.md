Ben Eater 8-Bit Breadboard Computer (In Progress)

I’m currently building Ben Eater’s 8-bit breadboard computer as a hands-on extension of what I’m learning in CS 61C (Computer Architecture) at UC Berkeley. So far I’ve completed the clock module, registers, and ALU, and I’ll be finishing the remaining modules as I progress through the course.

This project is helping reinforce key architecture concepts — control logic, datapaths, arithmetic units, and timing — by implementing them directly in hardware at the breadboard level. Will update repo, after finishing with cool programs to run on this computer!! Excited :).
